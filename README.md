# Solidity

This is a research project to deploy a course admission system for UNSW.<br/>
Users who want to apply for a course bid using an ERC20 token, which they have to buy using ETH.<br/>
Every once in a while, a school administrator runs the RoundCloses() function to close the round and admit students to courses, releasing the tokens for failed students to bid on the next round.<br/>
The whole contract is written with simplicity and gas-efficiency in mind.<br/>
For more information, please read the report PDF.<br/>

Truffle test scripts also attached which test admission scenarios successfully.
